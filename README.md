### About The Project

Save and share your kid craft or drawing with others before you put them to the "storage bin".
I did this project as my final project of my Course Careers Software Development Fundamentals.
For the backend, I used Golang with gorm to create the API. I'm using a cloud based PostgreSQL database with ElephantSQL. Pictures are uploaded & stored to Amazon S3. It's hosted with Render.
For the frontend, I used Next.js. It's hosted with vercel.

### How I Prepared For The Project

With figma I created a basic fome page idea
